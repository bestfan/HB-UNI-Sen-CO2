# HB-UNI-Sen-CO2-STM32
CO2 Sensor for Homematic with STM32

Inspired by the excellent work of [MHSteve](https://github.com/HMSteve/HB-UNI-Sen-CO2/blob/main/README.md) I enhanced his solution by the following features:
- Use of STM32 boards (Blue Pill or Maple Mini)
- Compatibility with standard casing (86x86 mm)
- Use of Winsen MH-Z19 CO2 Sensor instead of SCD30 as option
- Use of touch pad as config button
- Use of RGB LED for traffic light instead of red/green LED

Due to the missing battery support of the STM32 boards and the space restrictions I left out the rechargeable batteries which seems to be bearable for me, since a power supply is needed anyway.

Here you can see some photos how the assembled boards look like

And here how the sensor casing looks at the end
